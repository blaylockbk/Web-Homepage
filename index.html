            <h3><i class="fa fa-globe" aria-hidden="true"></i> About the HRRR archive</h3>
            <h3>What is this HRRR archive?</h3>
            <p>This HRRR archive is a collection of output from NCEP's High Resolution Rapid Refresh model. This
               is a model developed by <a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/" target='_blank'>NOAA ESRL</a>
               and is run operationally every hour at NCEP's Environmental Modeling Center.
               It continues to be developed by ESRL.
            <p>The operational HRRR generates hourly forecasts gridded at 3 km 
               for 18 hours over the contiguous United States making it the
               highest spatial and temporal resolution forecast system run by NCEP.

               HRRR Variable Details
               </a>
            <p>HRRR analyses and forecasts are exceptionally valuable to the 
               research community. However, an official HRRR archive does not exist.
               We began archiving HRRR data in April 2015 to support
               research efforts at the University of Utah. The archive system 
               <a href"http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/Pando_archive/Pando_Failure.html">failed</a>
               and we lost all the data. We rebuilt the archive and began
               storing data starting with 28 December 2017.
            <p>Instead of storing all available HRRR files, we only download the
               files most useful to accomplish our research efforts. We realize
               this data is valuable to many others and have made the
               archive publicly accessible for research purposes. We currently 
               have 60 terabytes at our disposal.

               or Gridded Binary Version 2, is a standard file format used 
               by meteorologists for model data sets. There are several useful 
               tools for working with the data.

            <h3>Where do the HRRR output files come from?</h3>
            <p>The operational HRRR (hrrr) is downloaded via HTTP from the <a href="http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/">NOMADS server</a>.
            <p>Experimental HRRR (hrrrX) and HRRR Alaska (hrrrak) are downloaded via FTP from NOAA ESRL (credentials required).
            <hr>
            <h3>What version of HRRR is in this archive?</h3>
            <p><b>HRRRv1</b> was the operational model prior to August 23, 2016.
            <p><b>HRRRv2</b> was implemented at NCEP on August 23, 2016 beginning
            with the 12z run. We download the operational version from <a href="http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/hrrr/prod/">NOMADS</a>.
            For more details on the HRRRv2 implementation, read the <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/notification/tin16-26rap_hrrrraaa.htm">announcement</a>
            <p><b>HRRRv3</b> is the current experimental version under development and testing at ESRL.
            It is expected to become the operational model in May 2018 
            (<a href="http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/CCS_Science/5.RAPv4_HRRRv3.Q2-2017.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>).
            Version 3 will extend the forecast period for the 00, 06, 12, and 18 run
            out to 36 hours. Improvements in version 3 include updated Thompson
            microphysics, improved MYNN PBL scheme, updated land surface model
            with 15 second MODIS data, refined roughness lengths for 
            certain land use types, and additional improvements in assimilation methods
            including new dataset like lightning and radar radial velocity. 
            <p><b>HRRRv4</b> will be the next developmental version at ESRL and
               with expected implementation in 2020. This version will make more
               use of ensemble modeling methods.

            <h3>When do we download the HRRR data?</h3>
            <p><b>HRRR</b>, <b>HRRR-X</b>, and <b>HRRR-Alaska</b>
               is downloaded from NOMADS and ESRL four times a day at
               00:20, 06:20, 12:20, and 18:20 UTC.
            <p>We only download HRRR data four times a day to prevent anyone
               from grabbing real-time forecasts from us because this HRRR
               archive is not meant to be used for real-time or operational
               products. 
               <i>Again, if you are looking for HRRR data from the last
               two days, download the files directly from
               <a href="http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/hrrr/prod/">NOMADS</a></i>.

            <h3>Vision for the Future</h3>
            <p>This project is turning into a classic
               case of one of my favorite children's books <i>If You Give A Mouse A
               Cookie</i> where starting one thing has grown and continues to grow
               into something bigger.
            <p>At the 2017 Annual AMS meeting I talked with a guy on the the
               AMS Board on Data Stewardship. He said the lack of 
               a HRRR archive was one concern brought up at their board meeting.
            <p>Archiving high resolution model data is an expensive task. 
               This is a growing issue in the atmospheric science community
               as we move to higher resolution models that generate terabytes of
               data annually. At the 2018 Annual AMS meeting, it sounds like 
               NOAA is interested in pushing the HRRR output to its 
               <a href='http://www.noaa.gov/data-community-resources'>Big Data</a> 
               partners.
            <p>There are many opportunities with cloud computing were we "bring the
               data to the computing." An archive on the cloud can be
               kept in one place and researchers can use cloud resources to 
               process the data, perform analyses, and initialize WRF simulations
               without downloading the model output on their own computers.
               It would especially be beneficial if it were possible to efficiently mine the large
               dataset for a specific variable at a point or subgrid
               for a range of dates or times. Perhaps this model data needs to be stored in
               HDF5 format rather than grib2. It would be nice if there was fewer
               redundant data fields between the files. For instance, some fields 
               are available in the prs and sfc and nat files.
               The benefits and complications of
               cloud computing were discussed at the
               <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/events/2017CloudModelingWorkshop/#schedule">
               2017 Modeling Research in the Cloud</a>  Workshop.
            <p>Until those challenges are overcome, I would like to make this
               HRRR archive easily available to everyone to demonstrate the
               interest and need for having such an archive.
               This archive has already proven beneficial to many researchers
               and has served many applications.
            <p>In the future, it is possible to have server-side data processing
               that generate time series or wind roses for point locations 
               in the HRRR model. My current methods for doing this are extremely 
               inefficient because they still require downloading a temporary file
               for a single variable of the entire grid (which contains about 1.9 
               grid points over the contiguous United States).
            <hr>
            <p> If I were in charge of the HRRR, I would like to see a more 
            rapid data assimilation cycle and run the model every 15 minutes
            out to a 48 hour forecast. This would ultimately create 7 times as
            much data while providing a 96 members for time-lagged ensembles.
            My dream for a future weather prediction system is a model that is
            <i>continuously updating</i>.
            <p>The main concept of this archive is to create a HRRR archive in one place so
            researchers don't have to redundantly store local archives, with the
            purpose to provide the data you need, when you need it.

            <h3>Why do we archive the HRRR?</h3>
            <img align=right class='style11' width=400 style="margin-left:20px" src="./images/June2017_NCAR.PNG">
            <p>While you can find current HRRR output at <a href="http://www.nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/">NOMADS</a>,
            there is no official HRRR 
            archive that is publicly and easily available, to our knowledge.
            This "gap" in the NOAA data archives will hopefully be filled in
            the future, seeing that their vision is that all NOAA environmental
            data shall be <i>Discoverable, Accessible, Useable, and Preserved</i>.
            We hope to be part of the solution to that goal.
            <p>This HRRR archive has been created to support various research
            endeavors in the
            Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Utah.
            Things we do include:
            <ol style="padding-left: 60;">
                <li>Initialize the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model with HRRR analyses as initial
                and boundary conditions. <a href="http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/hrrr.html">More info here</a>.
                <li>Model verification, where HRRR analyses and forecasts are compared to observed conditions.
                <li>Retrospective analysis of high-impact weather events.
                <li>Basic statistics of variables (max, min, mean, percentiles).
                <li>Potential work with machine learning applications.
            </ol>
            <p> This archive allows us to perform analysis of the HRRR model
                performance, independent of the ESRL folks, for our own research purposes and goals.
            <br>
            <p> You are welcome to use the archive for your own research, but
                as a courtesy, please register and read the "Best Practices"

            <i class="fa fa-server" aria-hidden="true"></i> What is the Pando archive?</h3>
            
            <p><b>Pando</b> is a colony of quaking aspen trees in southern Utah,
                thought to be the oldest and largest living organism in the world,
                linked together by the same root system.
                According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_%28tree%29">Wikipedia</a>,
                Pando is Latin for "I spread". 
                The name is fitting for the CHPC object storage system
                because of its resilience and scalability, like
                the tree system.
            <p>The underlying software running Pando is 
               <a href="http://ceph.com/">Ceph</a>, a project supported by RedHat.
               While Ceph can be configured in a few ways, in this archive Ceph
               manages the data objects with the Amazon S3 API. It is a separate
               "island" from the rest of CHPC file system so that output from 
               other programs cannot write directly to it. Instead, files are
               copied to Pando through utilities like rclone or s3cmd.
            <p>Pando is built in three parts. All of these can be scaled to 
               meet needs of the growing archive.
               <ul style="padding-left:50px">
                   <li>9 OSD Servers (16 8TB drives, each) - These contain the data objects.
                   <li>3 Monitors - Monitors keep a map of the data objects. When a request for data is made, these monitors are contacted for the object map and return the object's ID.
                   <li>1 RADOS Gateway node - You, as the client, make requests through this gateway for data downloads.

            of Utah, particularly my own research for my Master and PhD degrees.
             For example, I used HRRR analyses to 
            <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JAMC-D-16-0216.1">initialize WRF simulations</a>.
            
            <p>The archive is searched for quite often by people like you.
               Since this archive has been published online I have received
               inquiries and download requests from
               National Weather Service employees,
               NASA scientists,

            <h3>Composite Percentiles</h3>
            <p>I created 2-year "climatologies" or composites of wind speed,
                 temperature, and other variables for every hour of the day for an almost two year period.
                These may be used for MesoWest range checks to flag suspect or bad observations.
            <p>You can view all my climatological plots in the gallery
               <a href="http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/PhD/HRRR/climo/photo_viewer.php"><b>here</b></a>.
               I managed to get the computation time to find the
               max, min, and mean values for the ~2 years of data down to
               20 minutes using 30 processors, (much better than 5 hours on a single
               processor). Brute-force calculations of percentiles takes quite a bit more time and memory.
               1, 5, 10, 90, 95, and 99th percentiles where done for each hour of every day
               in the two years, and those took about one hour (download time from Pando and calculation) per variable.
            <p>The HRRR analyses mean winds are comparable with the results of

            <p>Do you work/study at the University of Utah, too? Cool! Go Utes!!
            Here are a few helpful tips that will make your life easier. That is, 
            if your life involves using HRRR data from our handy archive.
            Please share with me cool stuff you learn! 
            
            <hr>
            <h3>I have stuff in my own Pando buckets. How can I view those files in a browser?</h3>
            <p>The HRRR download page is a custom-built interface for accessing files in the HRRR buckets,
            but what if you have your own buckets in Pando? You're in luck, 
            because I created this more generic web interface for viewing and downloading 
            file objects in your Pando buckets that look more like the Apache file explorer.

            <hr>
            <h3>Is the archive on the local file system?</h3>
            <p>Yes, we keep a backup of the HRRR archive on horel-group7.
            <div class="well well-sm"><span style="font-family:monospace">/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/horel-group7/Pando/</span></div>
            <p>Then navigate to the HRRR directory you are interested:

            <h3>How do I get the HRRR data if what I'm looking for is compressed?</h3>
            <div class="alert alert-danger"> 
            There is still some HRRR data that is compressed on the local file system
            but it's much quicker to get it from PANDO. Still, this may be
            useful for getting other stuff out of the compressed archive, so I'll
            keep it here as a reference. (It took me many web searches before I
            figured out how to make this work, so I don't want to lose this
            token of knowledge.)
            </div>

            <p>If you find that what you're looking for is compressed, the
            following instructions will help get what you need:
            <ol style="padding-left:60px">
                
                <li>
                    <p>Copy the <b>models.tar.gz</b> file to your own space. 
                    Yes, this is large (~20 GB). It contains
                    all the model data we archive (I warned you that this was
                    inefficient).
                <li>
                    <p>Before untarring the entire directory, you can check if
                       it contains the files you need with something like this:
                    <div class="well well-sm" style="font-family:'Courier';">less -p /hrrr/hrrr.t models.tar.gz</div>
                <li>
                    <p>You can untar the entire file, but that would take a looonng
                    time, and you don't need everything in that file anyways.
                    <p>You can extract just the HRRR data with this one-liner...(still
                    takes a bit of time)
                    <div class="well well-sm" style="font-family:'Courier';">tar -xzvf models.tar.gz 20160101/models/hrrr/</div>

                    <p> Or you can get more creative and use the following
                    to get just the pressure fields. (In this case
                    it helps to know the contents of the tarred file).
                    Starting in the directory you wish to copy the
                    files into, type...
                    <div class="well well-sm" style="font-family:'Courier';">
                    tar -zxvf models.tar.gz --wildcards --no-anchored 'hrrr.t*z.wrfprsf00.grib2'
                    </div>
            </ol>
