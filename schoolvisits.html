            <p> I was nine years old when I decided I wanted to be a meteorologist. 
                The event that sparked my interest was the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Salt_Lake_City_tornado">1999 Salt Lake Tornado</a>.
                I remember playing outside with my friends in the backyard on the windy day. After
                hearing about the tornado, my eyes were glued to the TV, flipping between
                news stations, listening to 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/kCsC8Y9OPDM">Mark Eubank</a>, talk about the tornado and its 
                movement through downtown. Other experiences in my life fueled my interest
                in meteorology. As early as 2<sup>nd</sup> grader, my mom bought be a 
                book from the Scholastic book order called <i>I Can Read About Weather</i>.
                In 9<sup>th</sup> grade my earth systems teacher taught about fronts 
                and pressure systems, and global circulation. I was fascinated. Around 
                that time, I emailed Mark Eubank and asked him what I would need to do in 
                high school to prepare for college to become a meteorologist. He replied
                that I should study well in my math and science courses, as well as learn
                some computer programming. My senior year of high school opened many
                opportunities to prepare to become a meteorologist. I took a TV broadcasting
                class, where my crowning moment was giving a weather report for the school
                district news station. I took AP Calculus which had story problems related
                to temperature changes over time. My counselor, Ms. Anderson, suggested
                I take a district learning class through UVU, Meteorology 1010. That class
                sealed the deal. I was interested in meteorology, I was good at it, and I
                decided I was going to become a meteorologist. I later attended the 
                University of Utah and earned my Bachelor and Master's degree in atmospheric
                science. Today, I am working on my PhD. When I look back, I am amazed at
                the many opportunities that lead me to where I am and prepared me for the 
                work I am doing.
            <p> <img src='./images/school2.jpg' align='right' style="padding-left:15px">
                Other meteorologists have similar stories as mine. They often developed 
                their interest in the weather from a young age. That is why I love teaching
                the young people about the weather. I hope the kids I talk to have a new
                understanding of how the things they learn in the classroom relate to 
                the weather and have increased appreciation for knowledge. For some, I 
                hope my visit to their classroom is another opportunity that fuels their
                interest in studying the atmosphere or sparks a new interest to become
                an atmospheric scientist.
