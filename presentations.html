	<h3>WRF Simulation of a Summer Ozone Event in the Salt Lake Valley Initialized from HRRR Analyses</h3>
	<h4>  January 13, 2016</h4>
	<p> A presentation at the AMS annual meeting 19th Joint Conference on the Applications of Air Pollution Meteorology.
    Received 2nd place oral presentation award.
    <p> <img align=right style="padding:10px" width="300px"src="./images/ams_talk.jpg">
    ABSTRACT: Poor air quality on the afternoon of 18 June 2015 resulted from lake breeze transport of high ozone concentrations 
    from over the Great Salt Lake into the Salt Lake Valley. An extensive network of near-surface ozone observations were available 
    at this time as a result of the 2015 Great Salt Lake Summer Ozone Study (GSLSO3S). Observations in northern Utah were available 
    from sensors at a dozen state air quality measuring sites, additional fixed locations, vehicles, a light rail car, unmanned aerial 
    vehicles, tethered and free-flying sondes, and a traffic helicopter. Meteorological conditions were monitored from nearly a hundred 
    automated weather stations as well as surface-based remote sensors (ceilometers, sodars, lidar) at several locations.
    Simulations of the atmospheric conditions during this day were completed using the WRF model at 1 km horizontal resolution over northern 
    Utah. The model was initialized using hourly analyses at 3 km resolution from the NCEP High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model. The 
    HRRR is an operational data assimilation system that uses the WRF model as well. Our effort is the first one to use this state-of-the-art 
    data assimilation system as a means to initialize the WRF for research simulations of an air pollution episode. The results from these model 
    simulations are compared to the HRRR analyses as well as the observations available as part of the GSLSO3S study. The ozone data from the 
    traffic helicopter are of particular interest during this case, as they show high levels of ozone aloft at the lake breeze front boundary. 
    The ability of the WRF model to simulate this narrow boundary is investigated.

    <p>Questions received:
    <p>1. Why is the HRRR lake temperature so cold? <i>I have no idea. Maybe need to ingest higher resolution sea surface/skin temperature data. It doesn't appear
    the WRF model changes the lake surface temperature from timestep to timestep. So, where is HRRR getting its lake temperature and why doesn't it change?</i>
    <p>2. What was the reasoning for choosing the location for the plumes that I did. <i>Wanted a plume ahead and behind the lake breeze front.</i>
    <p>3. How well is this model verified? <i>It's better than the default options. Look at verification at 2-dozen sites <a href="http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/MS/timeseries/early/303/urban-HItrees/">here.</a></i>

	ABSTRACT: Ozone and meteorological sensors deployed during summer 2015 near the Great Salt Lake led to an 
	unprecedented glimpse of the creation, transport, and destruction of ozone affecting residents of the Wasatch 
	Front. Researchers from the University of Utah, Utah State University, and Weber State University and the Utah 
	Division of Air Quality studied the distribution of boundary-layer ozone.  Wasatch Front residents were exposed 
	to ozone levels exceeding the current EPA standard on a number of days during June 2015. Smoke from western 
	wildfires contributed to reduced air quality in northern Utah during August as well. In addition to data collected 
	continuously over the summer, extensive data were collected during scheduled and opportunistic observing periods 
	from sensors mounted on  vehicles, a light rail car, unmanned aerial vehicle, tethered sonde, paraglider, and 
	traffic helicopter. To identify, plan operations for, and study high ozone episodes as they developed, data from 
	most of these ozone were collected in real-time and related to meteorological conditions at the surface and aloft.
	 An overview of the field study and preliminary results will be presented.

	<h3>Relationship between Great Salt Lake level and lake breeze from pibal and rawinsonde observations</h3>
	<h4>April 2015</h4>
	<p>In my environmental statistics class our final project was to do a statistics based research project.
	This paper investigates the relationship between upper level winds observated at the Salt Lake International Aiport
	between 1926 and 2015 and the lake level. THIS HAS NOT BEEN PUBLISHED, but I did get a good grade on it.
	<p>If you look at this time lapse of the Great Salt Lake since 1984 to present you'll see that the lake grows and shrinks
	from year to year. This paper explores how the lake level may influence the lake breeze winds.

	<h3>Boundary Layer Structures Associated With High Winter Ozone Concentrations in the Uintah Basin</h3>
	<h4>August 2014</h4>
	<p>The summer of 2014, immediately after graduating from the Univeristy of Utah with a degree in atmospheric sciences
	I worked more intensely with data from the Uintah Basin Winter Ozone Study. I presented a poster at the American
	Meteorological Society's 16th Conference on Mountain Meteorology  

	<p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> Ozone concentrations over twice the National Ambient Air Quality Standard were observed during February 2013 in the Uintah Basin, Utah with much lower concentrations observed at the same time of the year during 2014. These differences are attributable to the more extensive snow cover in 2013 compared to 2014. Aerosol backscatter data from a Vaisala CL-31 ceilometer are contrasted during those two winters. Alternating layers of high and low backscatter in the boundary layer associated with high and low pollutant concentrations respectively were observed during both winters. Depth of the boundary layer and wave structures in the stably-stratified layers above the surface cold-air pool are compared as a function of the underlying snow cover.

	<h3>Meteorological Influences on Surface Ozone in the Los Angeles Basin </h3>
	<h4>July 2013</h4>
	<p><img src="./images/SARP.jpg" width="50%" align=right>
    The summer of 2013 I participated in NASA's Student Airborne Research Program where I participated
	in five research flights on board NASA's DC-8 Flying Laboratory. Each student worked on their own 
	individual research project. I studied the influence of weather on ozone pollution in southern California.
	I gave an oral presentation on the University of Irvine campus and a poster presenation at the 2013 AGU meeting in San Fransisco.
	<p>Find oral presentation and slides <a href="http://www.nserc.und.edu/sarp/sarp-2009-2013/2013/sarp-2013-student-presentation-videos/la-air-quality-group/meteorological-influences-on-surface-ozone-in-the-los-angeles-basin">here</a>.

	<p><b>Abstract:</b> Ozone levels in the Los Angeles Basin have improved over the last twenty years due to reductions in pollutants responsible for ozone formation. Still, meteorological effects can increase or decrease ozone levels. This study was an attempt to identify weather patterns that contribute to elevated or depressed ozone levels at four sites in the South Coast Air Quality Management District in California. Hourly surface ozone and meteorological measurements were compared at sites in Santa Clarita, Los Angeles (North Main Street), Costa Mesa, and San Bernardino. Comparisons were made on sixty-two days with good air quality and sixty-five days with unhealthy air quality between the years 2008 and 2012. Days were selected between April and September based on the Los Angeles area Air Quality Index. Ozone concentrations were shown to be positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with absolute humidity. While temperature and humidity do not cause changes in ozone production, they are indicators of weather parameters that do. Days with warmer temperatures have less clouds and more solar radiation. Results show that unhealthy ozone levels occur on days when solar radiation exceeds 800 W/m2. Absolute humidity is related to ozone because it distinguishes between marine and continental airmass source regions. Low ozone levels were consistently observed near the coast in Costa Mesa. The highest ozone levels were found at the receptor sites, San Bernardino and Santa Clarita, downwind of Los Angeles. Finally, wind speed was found to limit ozone in Los Angeles, but no relation between wind speed and ozone was found at the receptor sites. The meteorological conditions that resulted in changes in solar radiation and air mass source region had the largest impact on ozone levels in the Los Angeles Basin.

	<h3>Weather Broadcasts</h3>
	<img height=150px align=right src="images/publications/SFCN_Logo.png">
	<p>The day of the 1999 Salt Lake tornado my eyes were glued to the news, 
	flipping all the channels, watching each of the meteorologists
	replay the same few minutes of tornado footage. I was fascinated 
	and decided what I wanted to be when I grew up--a broadcast meteorologist. 
	In high school I took a 
	TV broadcasting class with aspirations of becoming a broadcast meteorologist.
	(That same year I took my first meteorology class through Utah Valley University).
	<p>When I was 21 I got a job at the local TV station--Spanish Fork City Network (SFCN).
	There I filmed and edited high school and community events for the city's Channel 17.
	After nine months I made a pilot weather broadcast and convinced the station manager 
	to let make weekly weather broadcasts for the city news.
	No one else had ever made weather broadcasts for SFCN, so this job
	came with some challenges. 

	<p><img height=150px align=left src="images/publications/SFCN_17.png">There were lots of technical troubles. No one had used the chroma key (green screen)
	for presenting a series of slides and there was no way for me to know where I was pointing. 
	Also, you can't be in the broadcasting business without audio struggles (as you'll see in some of these videos).
	But the most difficult part was coming up with relevant information. You see, we filmed the city news and 
	weather on a Friday or Saturday, and it didn't air until Monday, and it would rerun three times a day until
	the next Monday. This was a struggle becuase, THE WEATHER CHANGES EVERY DAY, not once a week!
	Eventually, low budgets cut my three minutes of weather from the weekly city news.
	The end of my broadcast career ends with an intership at KUTV in Salt Lake City working with Sterling Poulsen 
	and other meteorologists. There I deepened my love and understanding for the weather, but I decided broadcasting
	was not for me. Now I am pursuing a career in research and teaching.
	<p>With that in mind, enjoy these nice, low budget weather broadcasts.

	<br>

	<p> <img width="40%" style="padding:10px;"align=right src="images/publications/brian_KUTV_screen.jpg">
	During fall semester of 2012 I did an internship with the KUTV weather team. I worked Tuesday and Thursday afternoons helping them prepare 
	for the four and five o&#39clock news show. I had the opportunity to work with each meteorologist at the station, but most days I worked with 
	Sterling Poulson and Jill Margetts. The internship was a good supplement to my Introduction to Atmospheric Science class because 
	I could see the weather principles I was learning in class applied in the professional workplace. I learned a lot about how to interpret 
	forecast models, where to access weather information, the importance of communicating the weather story to the public.

	<p> My role at this internship was to come up with my own forecast to compare with the other meteorologists, set-up the afternoon time-lapse 
	video, assit in the production of the on-air weather segment, create weather graphics for the news using the stations WSI software, and write a short paragraph describing 
	the weather which was published in the station&#39s webpage and the Salt Lake Tribune.
