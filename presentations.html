			<p>Questions received:
			<ol style="padding-left: 60px;">
				<li>Why is the HRRR lake temperature so cold? <i>I have no idea. Maybe need to ingest higher resolution sea surface/skin temperature data. It doesn't appear
				the WRF model changes the lake surface temperature from timestep to timestep. So, where is HRRR getting its lake temperature and why doesn't it change?</i>
				<li>What was the reasoning for choosing the location for the plumes that I did. <i>Wanted a plume ahead and behind the lake breeze front.</i>
				<li>How well is this model verified? <i>It's better than the default options. Look at verification at 2-dozen sites <a href="http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/MS/timeseries/early/303/urban-HItrees/">here.</a></i>

			<h3>Weather Broadcasts</h3>
			<img height=150px align=right src="images/publications/SFCN_Logo.png">
			<p>The day of the 1999 Salt Lake tornado my eyes were glued to the news, 
			flipping all the channels, watching each of the meteorologists
			replay the same few minutes of tornado footage. I was fascinated 
			and decided what I wanted to be when I grew up--a broadcast meteorologist. 
			In high school I took a 
			TV broadcasting class with aspirations of becoming a broadcast meteorologist.
			(That same year I took my first meteorology class through Utah Valley University).
			<p>When I was 21 I got a job at the local TV station--Spanish Fork City Network (SFCN).
			There I filmed and edited high school and community events for the city's Channel 17.
			After nine months I made a pilot weather broadcast and convinced the station manager 
			to let make weekly weather broadcasts for the city news.
			No one else had ever made weather broadcasts for SFCN, so this job
			came with some challenges. 

			<p><img height=150px align=left src="images/publications/SFCN_17.png">There were lots of technical troubles. No one had used the chroma key (green screen)
			for presenting a series of slides and there was no way for me to know where I was pointing. 
			Also, you can't be in the broadcasting business without audio struggles (as you'll see in some of these videos).
			But the most difficult part was coming up with relevant information. You see, we filmed the city news and 
			weather on a Friday or Saturday, and it didn't air until Monday, and it would rerun three times a day until
			the next Monday. This was a struggle because, THE WEATHER CHANGES EVERY DAY, not once a week!
			Eventually, low budgets cut my three minutes of weather from the weekly city news.
			The end of my broadcast career ends with an internship at KUTV in Salt Lake City working with Sterling Poulsen 
			and other meteorologists. There I deepened my love and understanding for the weather, but I decided broadcasting
			was not for me. Now I am pursuing a career in research and teaching.
			<p>With that in mind, enjoy these nice, low budget weather broadcasts.

			During fall semester of 2012 I did an internship with the KUTV weather team. I worked Tuesday and Thursday afternoons helping them prepare 
			for the four and five o&#39clock news show. I had the opportunity to work with each meteorologist at the station, but most days I worked with 
			Sterling Poulson and Jill Margetts. The internship was a good supplement to my Introduction to Atmospheric Science class because 
			I could see the weather principles I was learning in class applied in the professional workplace. I learned a lot about how to interpret 
			forecast models, where to access weather information, the importance of communicating the weather story to the public.

			<p> My role at this internship was to come up with my own forecast to compare with the other meteorologists, set-up the afternoon time-lapse 
			video, assist in the production of the on-air weather segment, create weather graphics for the news using the stations WSI software, and write a short paragraph describing 
			the weather which was published in the station&#39s webpage and the Salt Lake Tribune.
