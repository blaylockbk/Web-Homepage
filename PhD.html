	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p>Residents of many coastal metropolitan areas are often exposed to unhealthy levels of ozone during summer. High ozone levels in
coastal zones are common because offshore shallow stable boundary layers tend to decrease vertical mixing and concentrate ozone
and precursor pollutants in a shallow layer near the surface. Thermally-driven flows between lakes or oceans and coastal urban and
suburban areas subsequently may recirculate ozone and ozone precursors within the stable boundary-layer. Forecasting the evolution
of coastal ozone events is a current challenge to air quality forecasters requiring high resolution numerical models. Preliminary work
shows that these models are sensitive to the surface state, such as coastal water temperature and urban land cover properties.
    <p>Many operational weather and air quality models poorly initialize the underlying surface state in coastal areas, which can adversely
affect the ability of numerical simulations to properly forecast boundary-layer depth and the timing and intensity of thermallydriven
flows. In this proposed work, remote sensing estimates of the surface state will be used to improve simulations of the Weather
Research and Forecast model. The sensitivity of coastal boundary layer characteristics to water surface temperature, green vegetation
fraction, land use, urban properties, and albedo will be tested. The model simulations will be compared to observations from recent
and upcoming ozone monitoring field studies. Upon completion, this proposed work will fulfill NASAâ€™s Science Mission Directorate
to advance knowledge of our changing environment and improve life by using NASA remote sensing products to improve weather
simulations and air quality forecasts in coastal environments.
