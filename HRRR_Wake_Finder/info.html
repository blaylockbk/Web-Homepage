<h3>What is the HRRR Wake Finder?</h3>

	<p> The HRRR Wake Finder is a tool for boaters who are looking for the smooth, glass-like water--
	perfect conditions for water skiing and wake boarding. 
	<p>Lake chop is generally caused by:
	<ol>
		<li>Wind Speed
		<li>Wind Duration
		<li>Fetch - distance wind travels over water
	</ol>
	<p>Therefore, boaters who are looking for glass-like boating contitions are looking for areas
	of the lake that are the lest windy.
	<p>The HRRR Wake Finder makes forecasts from the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) weather 
	model available for boaters so they can know ahead of time which areas of the lake may 
	be less windy, giving them the advantage over other boaters.

	<img class="style2" src="http://www.skysailtraining.co.uk/images/waves.gif" align=Right width="400px"></a>
	As an example, this chart illustrates the relationshiop between wave height, wind speed, 
	wind duration, and fetch length. The chart is more useful for boaters on the ocean where
	large fetches, higher wind speeds, and wave height is greater, but you get the idea. 
	<p>When the wind speed is high, when winds last a long time, and when the fetch is 
	long, the water surface becomes more choppy as waves develop. These waves are caused by kinetic 
	energy being transfered from the atmosphere to the water surface.

<h3>How NASA uses the wind speed/wave height relationshiop</h3>
	<p><a href="http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/quikscat/index.cfm"><img class="style2" align=left src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/QuikScat.jpg/800px-QuikScat.jpg"></a>
	I imagine the relationshiop between wave height and wind speed has been well known by sailors and
	boaters	for some time now. In the modern science era, NASA has used this relationship to derive wind
	surface wind speeds over the ocean from  space. In 1999 NASA launched the QuickSCAT satellite, which
	used an active remote sensing technique for measuring wind speeds. It sent down burst of 
	microwave energy to earth which signal bounced off the surface and returned to the satellite. 
	This beam of energy is similar to a weather radar, but the frequency of this signal was designed to 
	penetrate clouds and precipitation. Ocean waters with larger wave heights would scatter more of the 
	signal and reduce the amount returned to the satellite. The amount of signal reflected back to 
	space could then be transformed to a wind speed and wind direction over the oceans.
	It was a polar orbiting satellite with a 1,800 km swath allowing it to observe nearly the entire earth
	in a single day. This instrament was increadibly valuable for weather forecasting (especially
	hurricane forecasting) and mariners. When the satatellie mechanics failed in 2009, NASA rapidly
	built a replacement.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuikSCAT">(See the Wikipedia article)</a>
	
	<p>The <a href="http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/RapidScat/">RapidScat</a> 
	instrament was installed on the International Space Station in 2014
	Below is an image of wind speed derived from the RapidScat instrament on January 28, 2015 when a strong winter storm was impacting the north east.

	<p> Of course, Utah Lake is too small for wind speeds to be observed by satellite. So sateelites don't
	directly help boaters. This section was just an interesting sidenote to satisfy my meteorological nerdyness.

<h3>What is the HRRR</h3>
	<p><img class="style2" align=left src="http://ruc.noaa.gov/hrrr/hrrrcrefimage"> 
	HRRR is a high resolution weather model that is updated every hour.
	Its purpose is to aid in short term weather forecasting on a regional level by 
	increasing model resolution (HRRR resolution is 3km whereas the NAM is at 12 km and the GFS at 13km) 
	and using additional data assimulation techniques including assimulating radar retrevals.
	That said, increased model resolution doesn't gaurantee better wind forecasts.
	Utah Lake is only 5 or 6 model grid points across.
	Please understand that it these models are flawed and actual weather conditions may be different.

<h3> Model Limitations</h3>	
<p>With this product you will see contoured plots that look like this:
<br><img src="http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/HRRR_Wake_Finder/sample.png" width="30%">
<p>The data has been contoured to enhance the readability.
However, keep in mind the the HRRR is only at a 3 km resolution. The raw data is gridded and actually looks like this:
<br>
<img src="http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/HRRR_Wake_Finder/HRRR_res.png" width="30%">
<p> A HRRR forecast for Lake Powell may not be very usefull to boaters becuase the grid size of the 
HRRR is still too large to resolve the canyon winds that exist.

<a name="PROCESS"></a>
<h3>Processing: How the tool works</h3>
	<p> This tool makes use of several programming languages and tools which include LINUX shell 
	scripting, CRON	job schedulur, MesoWest's API, Python, HTML, JavaScript, and PHP.
	<p>Every hour I do the following:
	<ol>
		<li> Get HRRR Forecast
		<li> Process raw HRRR and produce visualization
		<li> Compare to actual Observation (future addition)
		<li> Publish images to website
	</ol>

<a name="HOWTO"></a>
<h3>How to use the tool</h3>
	<ol>
		<li> Go to the <a href="http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/HRRR_Wake_Finder/">website</a> 
		<li> Select the water body you are interested in.
		<li> Mouse over or click each forecast hour. (May take a second or two for image to load)

<br><br>
<h3>How to read the charts</h3>	
	<p>If you are unfamilar with reading weather charts, here are some terms you should know.
	<ul>
		<li> <b>Model:</b> A simulation of weather conditions made by a computer for a certain area and time.
		<li> <b>Valid Time:</b> The time the weather model forecasted conditions for.
		<li> <b>Initilization Time:</b> The time the computer started its weather simulation.
		<li> <b>Wind Barb:</b> A image of a flag that indicateds the wind speed and direction.
	</ul>
