<hr>
<p><i>(Could be updated)</i>
<p>The HRRR archive is made possible by the resources at Utah's 
  <a href="https://chpc.utah.edu/">Center For High Performance Computing</a>.
<p>HRRR data is originally downloaded from NOMADS via HTTP and NOAA ESRL via FTP.
These original files are quite large (prs files are >380 MB and sfc files are >100 MB each hour!)
That means if you download prs analyses for one day that's over 9 GB!
<p>This is an unofficial HRRR archive.
<p>We do not guarantee HRRR data will be 
available for every day or every forecast hour.
<p>We do not provide this HRRR 
data operationally or in real time. If you are looking for real time, 
operational HRRR data please use
<a href="http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/">NOMADS</a>. 
<p>This archive is provided as a friendly service. By using the archive, you
agree to the following:
<ul style="padding-left:60px">
  <li> You will cite the NCEP/ESRL HRRR model and University of Utah MesoWest
       HRRR archive in works published where this data was used.
  <li> You will not download an excessive, unreasonable amount of data.
       For example, do not simultaneously initiate 50 download sequences on 50
       nodes. Instead, download each file sequentially.
  <li> You will call your mother on Mother's Day.
</ul>
<p>Submitting the registration form directs you to the download URL, which you
   can bookmark. The information we collect in the registration form is only
   used internally to keep a count of users and get an idea of what the archive
   is being used for. We may share the total count and general usage with the
   folks at NOAA's Earth System Research Lab.
