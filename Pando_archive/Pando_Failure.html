<p> The CHPC Pando archive system failed. All the archived HRRR
   (operational, experimental, Alaska) and GOES-16 files were lost.
<p> The failure has hindered my research activity, and we realize many of
   you relied on the data for your own work. We apologize for the
   inconvenience this may cause you and your organization. We remind you that
   the archive was an experimental system, and we never guaranteed these files
   would be available at any time.
<p> We plan on rebuilding the archive once the Pando system is repaired
   beginning with files from 1 January 2018. These repairs and data transfers
   may not be completed until mid-February.
   <div class='alert alert-warning'>
   If you have any raw HRRR
   grib2 files prior to January 2018 and would like to share those files with
   us, please 
   <a class='alert-link' href="mailto:brian.blaylock@utah.edu">let us know</a>.
   </div>

<p> In the meantime, limited archives exist other places.
<ul>
    <li> GOES-16 data can be found on 
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/goes/">Amazon S3</a> (last 60 days) and
            <a href="http://edc.occ-data.org/goes16/">OCC</a> (last 7 months).
    <li> HRRR data (this is the biggest bummer) is only available for the last
        two days on
        <a href="http://www.nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/hrrr/prod/">NOMADS</a>.

    <p> CHPC object storage (Pando) failure
    <p> You are receiving this message as you are the PI of a group that owns
       space on the CHPC archive storage solution, Pando.
    <p> As many are aware, we started to have issue with accessing
       the data on Pando about two weeks ago. There was an initial failure of a
       large number of encryption partitions on the drives, after which the
       system was never able to complete the rebuilding process. Analysis of
       the problem indicated the need for more memory in each of the servers.
       However, doubling the memory, which was done last week, did not help, as
       the rebuild process was stuck in a feedback loop from which it could not
       recover. At this point the state of the object store was already beyond 
       repair. We will mention that there is no issue with the hardware, other 
       for the need for more memory to support the number of objects/the amount
       of data, which we have already addressed. 
    <p> At this time, we have exhausted efforts to make the data accessible and
       have determined it is time to start a fresh installation - meaning that
       all data is lost. We will be starting this process on Monday January 29
       and will notify you when the storage is again available for use. We 
       estimate this will take about a week.
