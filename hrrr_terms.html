<hr>
<p><i>(Could be updated)</i>
<p>This is an unofficial HRRR archive.
<p>We do not guarantee HRRR data will be 
available for every day or every forecast hour.
<p>We do not provide this HRRR 
data operationally or in real time. If you are looking for real time, 
operational HRRR data please use the 
<a href="http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/">nomads</a> site. 
<p>This archive is provided as a friendly service. By using the archive, you
agree to the following:
<ul style="padding-left:60px">
  <li> You will cite the NOAA/ESRL HRRR model and University of Utah MesoWest
       HRRR archive in works published where this data was used.
  <li> You will not download an excessive, unreasonable amount of data.
       For example, do not simultaneously initiate 50 download sequences on 50
       nodes. Instead, download each file sequentially.
  <li> You will call your mother on Mother's Day.
</ul>
<p>Registration is optional, but is highly encouraged. Submitting the registration
    directs you to the download URL. The information we collect in 
    the registration form is only used internally to keep a count of users 
    and get an idea of what the archive is being used for. We may share the 
    total count and general usage with the folks at NOAA's Earth System Research Lab.
