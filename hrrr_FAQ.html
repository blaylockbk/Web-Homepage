            <b>Disclaimer: This is an unoffical HRRR archive. Becuase HRRR 
                data files are large and produced hourly, it takes up a lot of
                space, and we don't have the space or funds to keep those files 
                easily available for very long. The archived files you see online is all
                we have available. If you are looking for historical HRRR data
                more than a few months back, we probably don't have it. If you
                feel an official HRRR archive is important to science, please

                            <p>The HRRR archive is a collection of output from NCEP's High Resolution Rapid Refresh model. This
                                is a model developed by NOAA ESRL and is run operationally every hour at NCEP.
                                <p>The HRRR creates a forecast with 3-km grid spacing for 18 hours over the continental United
                                    States.
                                    <p>Output files contained in the archive include:

                                                <li>Pressure Fields in grib2 format ~315 MB (e.g. hrrr.t00z.wrfprcf00.grib2).

                                We are in the process of exploring other archiving methods that would make it easier to access
                                and keep things organized. Please understand, this is an expensive project and providing a 
                                public archive of HRRR data isn't exactly our top priority. We sure wish NOAA would provide
                                an archive through <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/rapid-refresh-rap">

                            <p>The archive is located on the MesoWest servers in two places. The URL you're looking for depends

                            <p>When we first started downloading the HRRR, we didn't realize it would be so popular. The archive
                                wasn't built in a way to effectively distribute the data to you. Because we have so much
                                stuff in our archive, we have to compressed most of the days. The most recent month or two
                                should be uncompressed, but if you find what you're looking for is compressed, follow the
                                following instructions to get what you need:

                                        <p>Go to the archive and navigate to the YYYYMMDD you are interested in. For example,
                                            <a href="https://api.mesowest.utah.edu/archive/20160101/">https://api.mesowest.utah.edu/archive/20160101/</a>.

                            <h3>Where does the HRRR output come from?</h3>
                            <p>HRRR output is downloaded from the <a href="http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/">NOMADS server</a>.
                            <p>Experimental HRRR and HRRR Alaska is downloaded from NOAA ESRL (requires credientials)

                            <h3>What version of HRRR is in this archive?</h3>
                            <p>Prior to August 23, 2016 we downloaded the operational HRRR from this URL: http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/nonoperational/com/hrrr/prod/.
                                This was HRRRv1. Although the URL says "nonoperational", it was the operational HRRR. The
                                files just hadn't been moved to the operational space. (In order to get the nonoperational
                                versions we would have had to downloaded from a password protected URL in the ESRL web space.)
                                <p>Some days and hours in our achive may not be available. Either because the forecast wasn't
                                    run, or our servers were not able to download the file quick enough (sometimes the download
                                    page is very slow).

                                    <p><b>HRRRv2</b> was implemented at NCEP on August 23, 2016 for the 12z run. That day I
                                        began downloading from the new URL <a href="http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/hrrr/prod/">http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/hrrr/prod/</a>.

                            <h3>What days have HRRR data available?</h3>
                            <p>We began downloading HRRR anaylsis for each hours on April 18, 2015 and have continued to download
                                since then.
                                <p>Data for 2015 are stored <a href="https://api.mesowest.utah.edu/archive/__archive5__/">here</a>,
                                    and data for 2016 are stored <a href="https://api.mesowest.utah.edu/archive/">here</a>.
                                    <p>Prior to July 27, 2016 only the analysis hours for the pressure and surface fields were
                                        downloaded from the NOMADS server.
                                        <p>On July 27, 2016 I began to download the surface fields for each forecast hour. Unfortunately,
                                            the pressure fields are large files (~315 MB per hour) and we have decided not
                                            to archive the forecasted pressure fields.

                                            <p>Tables describing the HRRR data availability for each month can be found here:

                            <p>The initial purpose of this HRRR archive was to serve atmospheric science research at the University
                                of Utah, mostly used by graduate students. For example, I used it to

                                <p>Since the archive has been published on-line I have received inquiries and download requests
                                    from National Weather Service employees, a researcher at the National Institute of Standards
                                    and Technology, a United State Air Force Captain, a commercial wind power company, university
                                    professors, graduate students, and post docs.
                                    <p>If this archive is useful to you, contact the most important person you know at NCEP
                                        and request they develop an official HRRR archive. Thank you.
