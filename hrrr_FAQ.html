            <h3><i class="fa fa-globe" aria-hidden="true"></i> About this HRRR archive</h3>
            <h3>What is the HRRR archive?</h3>
            <p>The HRRR archive is a collection of output from NCEP's High Resolution Rapid Refresh model. This
            is a model developed by NOAA ESRL and is run operationally every hour at NCEP. It continues to be developed by ESRL.
            <p>The HRRR generates hourly forecasts gridded at 3 km for 18 hours over the continental United
            States making it the highest spatial and temporal resolution forecast system run by NCEP.
            <p>HRRR analyses and forecasts are exceptionally valuable to the 
            research community. However, an official HRRR archvie does not exist.
            We began archiving HRRR data in April 2015 to support
            research efforts at the University of Utah. 
            Instead of downloading all available files, we only download files
            most useful to accomplish our research efforts. For the time being, 
            we are making the archive publicly accessible for research purposes.
            <p>Please understand that HRRR grib2 files are large. For instance,
            sfc files are >120 MB 
            and prs files are >380 MB each. If you download a day's worth of
            prs analyses, thats over 9 GB!
            <p>Output files, in grib2 format, contained in the archive include:

            <p>Some days and hours in our archive may not be available. Either
            the forecast wasn't run that hour (typical for the experimental models),
            or our download scripts failed to download everything.

                  
            <hr>
            <h3>Where does the HRRR output come from?</h3>
            <p>The operational HRRR (hrrr) is downloaded via HTTP from the <a href="http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/">NOMADS server</a>.
            <p>Experimental HRRR (hrrrX) and HRRR Alaska (hrrrAK) are downloaded via FTP from NOAA ESRL (credentials required).
            <hr>
            <h3>What version of HRRR is in this archive?</h3>
            <p><b>HRRRv1</b> was the operational model prior to August 23, 2016.
            We downloaded the operational HRRR from here: http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/nonoperational/com/hrrr/prod/.
            Although the URL says "nonoperational", it was the operational HRRR. The
            files just hadn't been moved to the operational space.
            <p><b>HRRRv2</b> was implemented at NCEP on August 23, 2016 for the 12z run. That day I
            began downloading from the new URL: <a href="http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/hrrr/prod/">http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/hrrr/prod/</a>.
            <p>For more details on the HRRRv2 implementation, check out the 
            following announcement: <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/notification/tin16-26rap_hrrrraaa.htm">http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/notification/tin16-26rap_hrrrraaa.htm</a>
            <p><b>HRRRv3</b> is the current experimental version under development and testing at ESRL.

            <hr>
            <h3>When do we download the HRRR data?</h3>
            <p>HRRR output for each day is downloaded from the NOMADS and ESRL
            servers each evening (Mountain Time) after 0000 UTC.
            It takes a few hours to download everything. So if you are looking for today's
            HRRR data, you'll have to wait until after midnight.
            We first download HRRR-Alaska, then HRRR-X, then the operational HRRR (that one takes the
            longest because we get the most from it.)
            <p>This HRRR archive is not meant to be used for real-time or operational products.

            <h3>Vision for the Future</h3>
            <p> At the 2017 Annual AMS meeting I talked with a guy on the the
            AMS Board on Data Stewarship. He said the lack of 
            a HRRR archive was one concern brought up at their board meeting.
            <p>Archiving high resolution model data is an expensive task. 
            This is a growing issue in the atmospheric science community
            as we move to higher resolution models that generate terabytes of
            data annually.
            Perhaps the solution is in cloud computing where the archive can be
            kept in one place and researchers can use cloud resources to 
            process the data, perform analyses, and initialize WRF simulations
            without downloading the model output on their own computers. It would
            especially be nice if you could mine for the exact data you wanted
            from the model output (a specific variable at a point or subgrid
            for a range of date/times). Perhaps model data needs to be stored in
            HDF5 format rather than grib2.
            <p>Until that happens, I would like to make this archive easily
            available to everyone to demonstrate the interest and need for 
            having such an archive. This archive has already proven beneficial
            to many researchers with many applications.
            <p>In the future, it is possible to have server-side data processing
            that generate time series or wind roses for point locations 
            in the HRRR model. My current methods for doing this are extreamly 
            ineffiecient becuase they still require dowloading a temporary file
            for a single variable of the entire CONUS grid.
            <p>In short, this project is turning into a classic
            case of one of my favorite children's books If You Give A Mouse A
            Cookie where starting one thing has grown and continues to grow
            into something bigger.

            <h3>Why do we archive the HRRR?</h3>
            <p>While you can find current HRRR output on the <a href="http://www.nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/">NOMADS server</a>,
            there is no official HRRR 
            archive that is publicly and easily available, to our knowledge.
            This HRRR archive has been created to support various research
            endeavours in the
            Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the Univerisity of Utah.
            Things we do include:
            <ol style="padding-left: 60;">
            <li>Initialize the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model with HRRR analyses as initial
            and boundary conditions. <a href="http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/hrrr.html">More info here</a>.
            <li>Model verification, where HRRR analyses and forecasts are compared to observed conditions.
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p> You are welcome to use the archive for your own research, but
                as a courtesy, please register and read the Best Practices before downloading from the archive (click buttons at top).

            <h3><i class="fa fa-database" aria-hidden="true"></i> Where is the University of Utah HRRR archive?</h3>
            <p>The physical archive is located at the University of Utah
            Downtown Data Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. It is hosted on 
            Utah's Center for High Performance Computing PANDO archive storage 
            system. This archive system is similar to Amazon's S3 storage, but
            this is less expensive. We are currently using almost 20 TB of 
            our 30 TB allocation. At the current storage rate (~65 GB/day)
            I expect the S3 archive will be full around mid-August
            2017. We will buy more storage if a proposal is funded, otherwise 
            we'll have to remove the HRRR forcast grids if we want to continue 
            saving HRRR data.
            <p>But you probably aren't interested in it's physical location.
            You want to know where you go to download from it. Our HRRR archive
            is made available for research purposes.
            We only ask that you fill out the registration form to help us 
            keep track of total usage and it's popularity.
            After registering you will be redirected to the download page. 
            There you will also find instructions for writing your own download
            scripts.

            <h3><i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> What days are available to download?</h3>
            <p>We began downloading HRRR analyses for each hours on April 18, 2015 and have continued to download
            since then (with some hiccups here and there).
            <p>Prior to July 27, 2016 only the analysis hours for the pressure and surface fields were
            downloaded from the NOMADS server.
            <p>On July 27, 2016 I began downloading the surface field forecast
            hours. (Unfortunately, the pressure field files are too large,
            ~315 MB/hr, and we have decided not to archive the forecasted pressure fields.)

            <p>The HRRR download page will give you an idea if the files you
            are looking for are available.

            <p> In summary:
            <ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
                <li>2015-04-18: Archive begins with analysis hours only
                <li>2016-07-27: started grabbing 15 hour sfc forecasts.
                <li>2016-08-24: started grabbing 18 hour sfc forecasts (HRRRv2 made operational).
                <li>2016-09-01: started grabbing select variables of experimental HRRR Alaska.
                <li>2016-12-01: started grabbing experimental HRRR surface analysis.
                <li>2017-03-01: HRRR archive moved from compressed space to S3 storage.

            <p>Many people are interested in the HRRR archive, including yourself
            (obviously, or else you wouldn't have Googled <i>'HRRR archive'</i>).
            <p>The initial purpose of this HRRR archive was to serve atmospheric science research at the University
            of Utah, particularly my own research for my Master and PhD degrees.
             For example, I used HRRR analyses to 
            <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JAMC-D-16-0216.1">initialize WRF simulations</a>.

            Since this archive has been published online I have received inquiries and download requests
            from National Weather Service employees, a researcher at the National Institute of Standards
            and Technology, a United State Air Force Captain, commercial wind power companies, university
            professors, graduate students, post docs, and many others.

            <h3>Composite Percentiles</h3>
            <p>I created 2-year "climatologies" or composites of wind speed,
                 temperature, and other variables for every hour of the day for an almost two year period.
                These may be used for MesoWest range checks to flag suspect or bad observations.
            <p>You can view all my climatological plots in the gallery
               <a href="http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/PhD/HRRR/climo/photo_viewer.php"><b>here</b></a>.
               I managed to get the computation time to find the
               max, min, and mean values for the ~2 years of data down to
               20 minutes using 30 processors, (much better than 5 hours on a single
               processor). Calculating percentiles takes quite a bit more time and memory.
            <p>The HRRR analyses mean winds are comparable with the results of

            Here are a few helpful tips that will make your life easier. That is, 
            if your life involved using HRRR data from our handy archive.
            Please share with me cool stuff you learn!

            <h3>Where is the archive?</h3>
            <p>We keep the most recent month or two in the horel-group/archive
            Modifiy the date directory for your day of interest.

            <p>Then navigate to the HRRR directory you are interested:

            <p>If you are interested in our process for downloading and archiving
            HRRR data, check out the GitHub repository.

            <div class="alert alert-danger"> 
            This is also outdated, but keep these around for future reference
            on getting stuff out of the compressed archive.
            </div>

            <p>If you find that what you're looking for is compressed, follow the
            following instructions to get what you need:
            <ol style="padding-left:60px">
                
                <li>
                    <p>Copy the <b>models.tar.gz</b> file to your own space. 
                    Yes, this is large (~20 GB). It contains
                    all the model data we archive (I warned you that this was inefficient).

                <li>
                    <p>Before untarring the entire directory, you can make 
                       sure it contains the files you need with something like this:
                    <div class="well well-sm" style="font-family:'Courier';">less -p /hrrr/hrrr.t models.tar.gz</div>

                <li>
                    <p>You can untar the entire file, but that would take a looooonng
                    time, and you don't need everything in that file anyways.
                    <p>You can extract just the HRRR data with this one-liner...(still
                    may take a bit of time)
                    <div class="well well-sm" style="font-family:'Courier';">tar -xzvf models.tar.gz 20160101/models/hrrr/</div>

                    <p> Or you can get more creative and use the following
                    to get just the pressure fields. (In this case
                    it helps to know the contents of the tarred file).
                    Starting in the directory you wish to copy the
                    files into, type...

                    <div class="well well-sm" style="font-family:'Courier';">
                    tar -zxvf models.tar.gz --wildcards --no-anchored 'hrrr.t*z.wrfprsf00.grib2'
